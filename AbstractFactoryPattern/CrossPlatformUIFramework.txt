# Abstract Factory Design Pattern Practice Problem

Here's a practical design problem to help you practice the Abstract Factory design pattern in C#:

## Problem Statement: Cross-Platform UI Framework

Design a cross-platform UI framework that can create consistent UI components for different operating systems:

1. The system should support multiple platform families:
   - Windows
   - macOS
   - Web/Browser
   - Mobile (iOS/Android)

2. For each platform, the system needs to create matching UI component families:
   - Buttons (PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton)
   - Text Fields (SingleLine, MultiLine)
   - Checkboxes and Radio buttons
   - Dropdown Menus
   - Dialog Boxes (Alert, Confirmation, Input)

3. The system should:
   - Ensure all UI components within a platform have consistent look and feel
   - Hide the platform-specific implementation details from client code
   - Allow switching between platforms without changing client code
   - Support adding new component types across all platforms
   - Support adding new platform families in the future

4. Each platform has specific requirements:
   - Windows: Uses Windows UI APIs and follows Windows style guidelines
   - macOS: Uses macOS UI APIs and follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines
   - Web: Uses HTML/CSS/JS for components following a responsive design
   - Mobile: Creates native components for Android and iOS

This problem is perfect for the Abstract Factory pattern because:
- It involves creating families of related objects (UI components)
- The components must be consistent within each platform family
- Client code shouldn't be concerned with platform-specific implementations
- New platforms or components should be easy to add

This is commonly asked in interviews because:
- It demonstrates your understanding of interface-based design
- It shows how you handle complex object creation hierarchies
- It tests your ability to design extensible systems
- It's a realistic scenario that many developers encounter
