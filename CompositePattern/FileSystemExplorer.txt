Problem Statement: File System Explorer
Design a file system explorer that allows users to navigate and manipulate a hierarchical structure of files and directories. 
Your implementation should:

Model both files and directories as components in the file system
Allow directories to contain files and other directories (creating a tree-like structure)
Support operations like:

Calculating the total size of any component (files have individual sizes, directories' sizes are the sum of their contents)
Displaying the structure with proper indentation to reflect hierarchy
Moving components between directories
Adding and removing components at any level
Searching for components by name across the entire structure

Implement specific operations for different types of components:

Files: Open, Edit, Save
Directories: Create, Delete, List Contents
Special handling for different file types (TextFile, ImageFile, ExecutableFile)

Support traversal operations to apply actions across the entire hierarchy:

Count all components
Find all components matching certain criteria (e.g., files larger than 1MB) --
Apply permissions or other attributes recursively --

This problem is commonly asked in machine coding rounds because it:

Tests your understanding of hierarchical structure modeling
Requires uniform treatment of both individual objects and compositions of objects
Demonstrates your ability to implement recursive operations
Shows how you handle polymorphism and inheritance
Provides a real-world example that most interviewers can easily understand
