Here's a design problem for practicing the Builder pattern in C#:

# Design Problem: Restaurant Order Management System

You are tasked with creating a restaurant order management system. The system needs to handle the creation of complex order objects that contain multiple components:

1. Basic order information (order ID, customer name, timestamp)
2. Food items (multiple items with customizations)
3. Beverage items (multiple items with customizations)
4. Packaging options (to-go, dine-in)
5. Payment information
6. Delivery details (if applicable)

The challenge is that orders may have different combinations of these components. Some orders might be for dine-in with no delivery details, while others might be to-go orders with specific delivery instructions. Some orders might include beverages, while others might not.

Using the Builder pattern, design a flexible solution that:
- Allows for creating orders with different combinations of components
- Maintains a clean, readable API for order creation
- Supports both a step-by-step construction process and a more direct approach
- Ensures orders are valid when constructed (e.g., to-go orders must have packaging)

This is a common type of problem in machine coding interviews because it tests:
1. Your understanding of creational design patterns
2. How you handle complex object construction
3. Your ability to design clean, maintainable code
4. How you implement validation logic

Let me provide more specific details about the complex order structure:

# Restaurant Order - Detailed Components

## 1. Basic Order Information
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for the order (auto-generated)
- **Customer Name**: Name of the person placing the order
- **Contact Number**: Phone number
- **Timestamp**: When the order was placed
- **Status**: Current state (e.g., Received, In-Progress, Ready, Delivered, Cancelled)

## 2. Food Items (can have multiple)
Each food item should include:
- **Item Name**: Name of the dish
- **Quantity**: Number of items ordered
- **Base Price**: Standard price before customizations
- **Customizations List**: List of modifications to the standard item
  - Examples: "No onions", "Extra cheese", "Medium spicy"
- **Special Instructions**: Additional preparation notes
- **Category**: Appetizer, Main Course, Dessert, etc.

## 3. Beverage Items (can have multiple)
Each beverage should include:
- **Beverage Name**: Name of the drink
- **Quantity**: Number ordered
- **Size**: Small, Medium, Large, etc.
- **Temperature**: Hot/Cold/Room temperature
- **Customizations List**: 
  - Examples: "Extra shot", "No ice", "Light sugar"
- **Container Type**: Glass, Paper cup, etc.

## 4. Packaging Options
- **Packaging Type**: Dine-in, Takeout, or Delivery
- **Special Packaging Requirements**: Eco-friendly, Separate containers for sauces, etc.
- **Utensils Required**: Yes/No
- **Napkins Count**: Number of napkins

## 5. Payment Information
- **Payment Method**: Cash, Credit Card, Online payment, etc.
- **Total Amount**: Sum of all items plus taxes and fees
- **Tax Amount**: Calculated tax
- **Tip Amount**: Optional tip
- **Discount Applied**: Any promotions or coupons
- **Payment Status**: Paid/Unpaid/Partially Paid

## 6. Delivery Details (if applicable)
- **Delivery Address**: Complete address
- **Delivery Instructions**: Special notes for the delivery person
- **Requested Delivery Time**: When the customer wants the order
- **Estimated Delivery Time**: System-calculated delivery time
- **Delivery Person**: Assigned delivery staff (if known)
- **Tracking ID**: For tracking the delivery status

## Additional Complexities to Consider:
- Some orders might have combo meals that combine multiple food and beverage items with a special price
- Orders might have different tax rates based on item type or location
- Time-based promotions might affect pricing
- Allergen information might need to be tracked
- Loyalty program integration with points earned/redeemed

This complex structure makes the Builder pattern particularly appropriate, as it lets you create orders step by step, with only the components that are relevant to a particular order type.
