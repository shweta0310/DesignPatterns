You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion. Let me provide a more focused problem statement specifically for the Factory Method pattern:

# Factory Method Design Pattern Practice Problem

Here's a clearer problem that focuses on the Factory Method pattern in C#:

## Problem Statement: Logging System

Design a logging system for an application that can create different types of loggers based on configuration or runtime requirements:

1. The system should support various logger types:
   - Console Logger (outputs to console)
   - File Logger (writes to log files)
   - Database Logger (stores logs in a database)
   - Network Logger (sends logs to a remote server)
   - Email Logger (sends critical logs via email)

2. Each logger type has:
   - A specific way to write log entries
   - Different initialization requirements
   - Different configuration options (file paths, connection strings, etc.)
   - Different formatting capabilities

3. The logging system should:
   - Allow client code to create appropriate loggers without knowing concrete classes
   - Let each derived class decide which concrete logger to instantiate
   - Support hierarchical logging (passing logs up to parent loggers)
   - Handle multiple logging levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical)

4. The design should enable:
   - Easy addition of new logger types
   - Runtime selection of logger based on configuration
   - Standardized logging interface for all client code
