Problem Statement: Library Catalog System
Design a library catalog system with the following requirements:

The library contains different collections of items: Books, Magazines, DVDs, and AudioBooks.
Each collection has different properties:

Books: Title, Author, ISBN, PublicationYear, Genre
Magazines: Title, Issue, PublicationDate, Publisher
DVDs: Title, Director, ReleaseYear, Duration
AudioBooks: Title, Author, Narrator, Duration


The library needs a unified way to iterate through all these collections without exposing the underlying implementation details.
The system should support different traversal methods:

For Books: Iterate by title (alphabetical), by author, or by publication year
For Magazines: Iterate by publication date, by title, or by publisher
For all media: Iterate by title alphabetically


Implement a feature that allows a librarian to check what items are available in each category, regardless of their internal storage mechanism.

This is a common type of problem in machine coding rounds because it tests:

Your understanding of design patterns
Your ability to create flexible, extensible code
How you handle different types of objects with a unified interface
Your practical implementation skills in C#
