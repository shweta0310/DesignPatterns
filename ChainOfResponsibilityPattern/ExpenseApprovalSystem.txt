Problem Statement: Corporate Expense Approval System
Design an expense approval system for a corporation where expense requests need to go through a chain of approvers based on the expense amount and category. Each level of management has different approval limits, and requests must be automatically escalated to the appropriate authority level.

Requirements:
There are four approval levels:
Team Lead (can approve up to $1,000)
Manager (can approve up to $5,000)
Director (can approve up to $20,000)
Vice President (can approve any amount)


Additionally, expenses should be categorized as:
Office Supplies
Equipment
Travel
Training
Entertainment


Special approval rules:

Entertainment expenses over $500 must be approved by at least a Manager
Training expenses over $3,000 must be approved by at least a Director
All equipment purchases over $15,000 need VP approval regardless of amount


If an approver rejects an expense, the process stops and the request is denied
The system should be flexible enough to add new approval levels or modify approval rules without changing the core logic

This problem is ideal for the Chain of Responsibility pattern because:

Each handler (approver) decides either to process the request or pass it to the next handler
Clients don't need to know which handler will ultimately process their request
New handlers can be added to the chain without modifying existing code
