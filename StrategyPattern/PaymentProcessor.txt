# Strategy Design Pattern Practice Problem

Here's a practical design problem to help you practice the Strategy design pattern in C#:

## Problem Statement: Payment Processing System

Design a payment processing system for an e-commerce application that supports multiple payment methods with different processing algorithms:

1. The system should support various payment methods:
   - Credit Card
   - PayPal
   - Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)
   - Bank Transfer
   - Mobile Payment (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
   - Gift Cards

2. Each payment method has its own:
   - Validation logic (different information required)
   - Processing algorithm (different APIs and steps)
   - Fee calculation (different rates and structures)
   - Refund handling

3. The payment system should:
   - Allow new payment methods to be added without modifying existing code
   - Let users switch between payment methods at runtime
   - Handle transaction logging consistently across all payment methods
   - Support payment method-specific features (e.g., partial payments for gift cards)

4. For each transaction, the system should:
   - Validate payment information
   - Process the payment
   - Calculate fees
   - Generate a receipt with appropriate details
   - Support refunds when necessary

This problem is excellent for the Strategy pattern because:
- It involves multiple algorithms (payment processing methods) that share a common purpose
- New strategies (payment methods) are likely to be added over time
- The strategy selection can change at runtime (user selecting payment method)
- Each algorithm has its own implementation details but a common interface

This is a common interview problem because it:
- Has real-world relevance
- Tests object-oriented design principles
- Shows how you handle extensibility
- Demonstrates your understanding of both the pattern and practical implementation concerns
