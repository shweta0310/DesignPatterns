Problem Statement: Configuration Manager

**Objective:** Design a thread-safe `ConfigurationManager` class that ensures only one instance exists throughout the application's lifecycle. This class should manage application-wide configuration settings loaded from a file

**Requirements:**

1. **Singleton Implementation:**
   -Ensure that only one instance of `ConfigurationManager` can be created
   -Provide a global point of access to this instance
   -Ensure thread safety during instance creation and access

2. **Configuration Loading:**
   -Load configuration settings from a file (e.g., JSON or XML) during the first access
   -Provide methods to retrieve configuration values by keys
   -Optionally, allow refreshing the configuration at runtime

3. **Usage Scenario:**
   -Multiple parts of the application should access configuration settings via the `ConfigurationManager`
   -Demonstrate that all accesses refer to the same instance
